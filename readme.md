This project of mine been a huge failure as instagram constantly took down my bot accounts and also that it was really annoying to handle reels, When I tried it so that you could watch reels from discord itself. I managed to get a link to the reel in several qualities in XML format apparently but when this was sent to discorrd it had no audio at all. Then I realized that Instagram perhaps plays the audio and video separetly but I was working again and I encountered a new type of reel, although the initial type that I've talked about above itself is called "clip" rather than reel, but it is the most basic form of reel you will encounter in your DM or group when you send someone and also apparently DMs and groups are called threads, quite suprising to me ngl. and other than this "clip" the other I encounted was called "media share", even this was quite annoying, although this had someone more data connected to it like caption and user details unlike the clip which just contained basic data like - like count and view count but no caption or no detail about the user but it contained data about video and audio in xml format. but as for the initial idea of cross chatting can easily be achieved but its just that I did not want to stop there and implement everything that happens in the two platforms in a text channel becomes accessible to the other but when I faced walls rather than challanges I decied to go down and work on my current main project rather than this side project that I had thought I would do as a simple break from my main project.
